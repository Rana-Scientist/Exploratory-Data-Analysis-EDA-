# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

As a Data Scientist, I recently completed an ETL pipeline and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a random free dataset. I have shared my work on both GitHub and Kaggle. I would greatly appreciate it if you could take a look at my work and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement. In this project, I covered several important aspects of data preprocessing and analysis.

Here's a summary of the tasks I performed:

·       Get Data from AWS S3 Bucket
·       Transform the Data Set (Data Exploration, insight information)
·       Column fixation process as there are huge exceptional cases e.g., special characters, unnamed columns, Numeric column names, Spaces in column's names, Title naming convention etc.
·       Converting Data Types
·       Dealing with Duplicate rows, Null or Missing values, Imputing Outliers using Mean, Mode, Median, Forward Fill, Backward Fill and capping techniques
·       Highlighting Categorical and Non-Categorical columns
·       Highlighting Outliers with multiple methods e.g., Boxplot, Scatter Plot, Histogram, IQR method etc.
·       Load the transform Data back to S3 Bucket for future analysis.
·       Descriptive Analysis, Quantile Analysis
·       Correlational Analysis with multiple techniques e.g., Pearson, Kendal, Spearman, Univariate/Bivariate/Categorical Analysis

·       Statistical Analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib library.

Once again, I kindly request you to review my work on GitHub and Kaggle. Your expertise and feedback would be immensely valuable in identifying any areas that require improvement or optimization.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I truly appreciate your assistance.
